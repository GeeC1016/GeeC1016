## Hi there 👋

✅ My name is Erika and I'm here to learn and develop my skills. 

📚 I'm currently working on improving my coding skills (Java). I know HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript as well. 

🏢 Career-wise, I aspire to be a fullstack developer to Software devlopment engineer in test. I'm still in the process of figuring out exactly what I want, so I haven't commited to any one thing.

🙌🏾 Nice to meet you all! I'm looking forward to collaborating with all of you!!
