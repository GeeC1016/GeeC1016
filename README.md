## Hi there 👋

✅ My name is Erika and I'm an aspiring Web Developer. 

📚 I'm currently working on improving my HTML and CSS skills so that my websites are more responsive and pretty. 

💻 I'm also interested in incorperating JavaScript into my websites, but my primary goal for the time being, is getting functional, good-looking websites/components up and running. 

🏢 I'm currently interning at the Brooklyn Public Library, on their Web Applications team and it's been a good learning experience thus far. 

🎓 I'm also attending Bard College based in Brooklyn, NY.

🙌🏾 Nice to meet you all! I'm looking forward to collaborating with all of you!!
